# 👋 Hi there!

 My name is Jakub, I am third-year Computer Science student at Lodz University of Technology. I always seek for new adventures and opportunities to be better, as a person and as a programmer! I can surely admit that I am distinguished by stubborness and conscientiousness, a person who loves self-development and constantly seeks for opportunities to learn new things!
